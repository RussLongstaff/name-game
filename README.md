## Notes

This project was an attempt at teaching myself some vanilla JavaScript whilst getting to grips with some of the basics of Photoshop.

It is currently a work in progress so expect bugs and other loading issues. Hopefully I will find time to refactor and improve the performance of the game during future iterations.

You can read the original notes and idea in Text Based Adventure/notes.docx.
